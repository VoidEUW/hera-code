"""Every table in the system, imported in one place.

Nothing is defined here. All models share one ``SQLModel.metadata``, and a model is only in it
once its module has been imported — so ``alembic autogenerate`` sees exactly the tables that
happen to have been imported by the time it runs. Left implicit, that means a package nobody
imported first is a package whose tables silently do not exist.

This module makes it explicit and testable: ``test_migrations.py`` holds :data:`ALL_TABLES`
against the metadata, so forgetting a package here fails a test rather than producing a migration
that quietly drops a table.

**`Project` is imported and unused, deliberately.** hera-code has no projects — a working tree is
the container, and it is a directory rather than a row. But the table is in `hera_chats`, which is
vendored and not edited (ADR 1), so it exists in the schema whether or not anything writes to it.
Leaving it out of this tuple would make the next autogenerate propose dropping it.
