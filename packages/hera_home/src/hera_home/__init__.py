"""Where Hera keeps her data, and the well-known paths inside it.

The one thing every package agrees on. It reads an environment variable and joins a few
path segments; it opens nothing, creates nothing and caches nothing.

Not caching is deliberate. A cached home would be captured at import time, which is before
a test fixture has had a chance to point it somewhere temporary — and the failure mode of
getting that wrong is writing into a real ``~/.hera`` during a test run.
