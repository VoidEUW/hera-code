"""The one event union: everything a model can emit, normalised.

This module is the contract the whole system is built around. ``hera_chats`` persists these,
``apps/core`` serialises them to Server-Sent Events, and the browser reduces them into a
message -- so a new kind of thing the model can do is **one new variant here**, not a new
parser somewhere above. The previous version of Hera had a parser on the server and a second
one in the browser that had to stay byte-compatible with it; that is the cost this union
exists to avoid.

Every variant carries a literal ``type`` so the union discriminates on the wire as well as in
Python.

    which cannot be emitted until the whole call has landed. Without it, a turn that spends two
    minutes writing a long argument shows *nothing at all* on screen for two minutes, and a
    person watching cannot tell a model that is working from one that has stopped.

    It carries the name and nothing else it could be wrong about. Reading a *partial* JSON
    object to guess at the arguments would be a second parser over model output, which is the
    one thing this union exists to avoid — the arguments arrive, whole, in ``ToolCallReady``.

    downstream treats this as something to *draw* rather than something to keep: it is streamed
