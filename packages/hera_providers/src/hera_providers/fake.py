"""A provider that answers from a script.

This is the load-bearing test tool of the whole project. Every layer above -- the tool loop,
the permission prompts, the persisted event stream, the SSE endpoint, the browser reducer --
is exercised against this class, so none of them ever needs a model running. Anything that
genuinely needs a live endpoint is marked ``@pytest.mark.live`` and stays out of CI.

A script is either a list of turns, consumed one per :meth:`FakeProvider.stream` call, or a
callable that decides each turn from the request it is given -- which is how a test drives a
tool loop: turn one asks for a tool, turn two sees the result and answers.

```python
provider = FakeProvider([
    tool_turn(tool_call("hera__search", {"query": "qwen3.6 release date"})),
    text_turn("Because ", "the weights are cold."),
])
```

A turn may also be an ``Exception``, which is raised instead of streamed — and an ``Exception``
*inside* a turn is raised at the point it is reached, so a stream that breaks half way through
is one list rather than a hand-written provider class. Both matter: the first is an endpoint
that is down, the second is the one a turn has to survive, because part of the answer arrived
and is worth persisting.
