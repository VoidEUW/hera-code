"""The Qwen adapter: stream chunks in, event union out.

Everything provider-specific about the target model is here and nowhere else. It does three
jobs, and the first two are the reason the file exists:

* **Reasoning.** Qwen served through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint reports its reasoning
  either in a ``reasoning_content`` field beside ``content``, or -- depending on the server
  and its chat template -- inline in ``content`` wrapped in ``<think>`` tags. Both are lifted
  into :class:`ThinkingDelta`, so no layer above ever sees a tag.
* **Tool calls.** They arrive as fragments indexed by position, with the arguments streamed as
  partial JSON. They are accumulated here and emitted whole -- preceded by one
  :class:`ToolCallStarted` as soon as the *name* is known, because the whole call can be
  minutes away and a person watching an empty screen cannot tell working from stopped.
* **Finish.** One :class:`TurnEnd` at the end, always, with the reason normalised.

This class is pure: no I/O, no httpx, nothing async. That is what makes the awkward part --
a ``<think>`` tag split across two chunks -- cheap to test exhaustively.
