"""The mind regions: what she is made of, and where each piece renders.

A **region** is one named slice of the system prompt, stored as one Markdown file in the git
repository at ``$HERA_HOME/mind``. This module is the registry — the single place that says
which regions exist, what each is for, where it lands in the prompt tree, and who is allowed
to rewrite it.

The registry is code rather than data on purpose. A region is only useful if something
renders it, and a row in a table can be added without anything rendering it; the constant
below cannot drift from :mod:`hera_profiles.builder`, because the builder is written against
it and ``test_regions.py`` holds the two together.

**Seed text is not her voice.** Every ``default`` here is a placeholder that says what belongs
in the region, deliberately plain. Her actual identity is written by editing these files —
that is the whole point of them being files — and ``docs/frontend.md`` lists it as still open.
Seeding them non-empty rather than blank matters anyway: an empty region renders as nothing,
and "she has no character" is indistinguishable from "the mind directory failed to load".

"""Every region, in the order the settings screen lists them.

Thirteen. The prototype had fifteen; ``grammar`` is gone because ADR 2 deleted the text call
grammar it described — shipping it would invite a call syntax nothing parses — and the two
memory regions collapsed into one until ``hera_memories`` gives the split a reason to exist.

``uncertainty`` and ``correction`` are the two newest, and they were added because the model
asked for them. Reading its own prompt, it reported two gaps in the same shape: nothing said
what to do when it is unsure of an answer, and nothing said what to do when it notices
mid-task that it is on the wrong track. Both are behaviours it will have *anyway* — every
model has some default for them — and a default that is nowhere in the mind is one nobody can
find and nobody can change, which is the same argument that gave ``language`` its own region.

They sit under ``approach`` rather than under ``conduct``, and that is a deliberate reading:
being unsure and being wrong are part of *how she works a problem*, not part of what she will
and will not do. It also makes them evolvable, so dreaming may propose changes — which is
right, because the useful version of "when should I ask?" is learned from conversations that
went badly, and is exactly the sort of thing ``hera_promptevo`` exists to notice. Nothing is
applied without a person accepting it, so the risk that stance drifts somewhere unhelpful is
the risk every evolvable region already carries.

``uncertainty`` is the half of the sentence that ``hera__ask`` is the other half of. Telling
her to ask when a question is worth asking, with no mechanism to ask one, would produce a
model that announces its confusion and then guesses anyway. It is also where the three kinds
``hera__ask`` now takes come from — *a fact only they have*, *hard to undo*, *two readings that
lead somewhere different* — so the tool's closed set and this region's prose say the same thing.

``language`` arrived as ``emotion_vocab`` left. Answering in English is a *behaviour*, and a
behaviour with no line in the mind is one nobody can find and nobody can change — "why does she
always answer in English" was a question with no screen to ask it on. Its own region rather than
a sentence inside ``tone``, because that is what makes it visible in a list.

``emotion_vocab`` and then ``emotion_usage`` left in the other direction. The vocabulary became
data on a screen, and ADR 17 then removed the whole feature: a stance she means is a sentence
she writes, and the region telling her *when* to file one has nothing left to be about. What it
was really asking for — react when you have a reaction, do not decorate — belongs to ``tone``
and ``character``, which are about how she writes rather than about a card. Files left over from
an older install (``mind/emotion_vocab.md``, ``mind/emotion_usage.md``) are ignored rather than
deleted; nothing here removes a file somebody may have written in.
