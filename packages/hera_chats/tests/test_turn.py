"""The turn loop, against FakeProvider and a scripted tool layer.

The assertions worth reading are about *ordering* and about what happens when something goes
wrong. A turn is the one place in this system where five packages meet, and almost every bug it
can have is a bug about sequence: a tool result reaching the model after the next question, a
permission card that never closes the stream, a cancellation that loses the half-written answer.
