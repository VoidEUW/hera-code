"""Projects, chats and messages.

A **project** is a container with behaviour, not a folder: a name, its own instructions, its
own pinned skills, and a default profile. ``docs/frontend.md`` holds the line — a *profile*
answers who she is, a project answers what we are working on, and the two compose. Projects
exist from the start because renaming folders into them later would be a migration for nothing;
their v0.2 half is files, which needs embeddings.

A **message** stores its whole event list. That is the record the interface re-renders from at
``done``, and it is why live view and reload cannot disagree.
