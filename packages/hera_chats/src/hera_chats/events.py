"""What a turn is made of, persisted and streamed.

``hera_providers.Event`` says what a **model** can emit. A turn is a bigger thing than that: a
skill was chosen before the model saw anything, a tool ran after it asked, a person was stopped
and asked whether it may. None of those come out of a model, so none of them belong in that
union — putting them there would mean ``hera_providers`` knowing what a skill, a tool and a
permission are, and it is the one package that must not.

So this union **wraps** that one. Three variants are re-used unchanged, with their ``type``
literals intact, so an event that crossed the provider boundary crosses this one without being
converted. The rest are Hera's own.

**``TurnEnd`` is deliberately not here.** It is the model's full stop for *one round trip*, and
a turn with tools in it contains several — streaming all of them to the browser would mean the
interface has to work out which one was the last. The orchestrator consumes them, adds up their
usage, and closes the turn once with :class:`TurnClosed`. One terminator, no arithmetic in the
client.

**``ToolCallStarted`` is here and is never persisted**, which is the other half of the same
distinction. It is in the union because it goes to the browser and everything that does is
serialised through here; it is not in :attr:`Turn.recorded` because it is *progress*, and the
stored list is the record of what happened. A call the stream broke off mid-argument never ran,
and history already says a call with no result never ran. The consequence to keep in mind: a
reloaded turn has strictly fewer events than the live one had, and the reducer has to produce
the same rows from both — which it does, because the started row and the ready row are the same
row, keyed on the call id.

Everything downstream keys off ``type`` and nothing parses text. A new kind of thing a turn can
contain is one new variant here, one branch where it is rendered, and nothing else.

Wider than the provider's ``FinishReason`` because more can happen to a turn than to a
generation: it can be waiting for a person, or have gone round the tool loop too many times.
``awaiting_permission`` is not a failure — the turn is intact and resumable, and the interface
shows a card rather than an error.

``awaiting_answer`` is the same shape and a different question. A permission card asks *may
I?*; an answer card asks something she wants to know, and the reply is prose rather than a
yes. Two reasons rather than one so the interface can say which is being waited on without
looking at the events before it — and because a turn stopped on a question is not one the
person can settle by clicking *allow*.
