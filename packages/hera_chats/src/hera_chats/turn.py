"""The turn: one message in, one event stream out.

This is the loop `ARCHITECTURE.md` draws. Skills are chosen in code, the mind is compiled into
a prompt, the slots are filled with what the layers below produced, the model is asked, and
every tool call it makes is checked and run — round and round until it stops asking for tools.

Three properties are worth stating up front, because each one is a decision that shows up in
the interface:

**Nothing here raises into the caller's loop.** A provider that dies, a stream that breaks, a
model that will not stop calling tools — each closes the turn with a reason and a last event.
The consumer is a Server-Sent Events response; an exception escaping mid-stream is a connection
that just stops, which the browser cannot tell from a network problem.

**Partial work survives.** ``Turn.recorded`` is complete at every moment, so whatever happened
before a cancellation or a failure is there to be persisted. That is what makes
``StreamInterrupted`` a `cancelled` turn with the answer so far, rather than a lost one.

**An ``ask`` stops the turn rather than blocking it.** The turn closes with
``awaiting_permission``, the events are persisted, and answering the card starts a *new* turn
that resumes the same message. A turn that held an HTTP response open waiting for a person
would be a turn that dies with the tab.
