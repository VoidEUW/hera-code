"""What a turn needs from the tool layer, expressed as a protocol.

``hera_tools.ToolRegistry`` satisfies this exactly and is what the application passes. The
protocol exists anyway, for two reasons.

It says what the turn actually uses — three methods out of a much larger class — so reading
this file tells you the whole of the coupling. And it lets a test drive the tool loop with a
handful of scripted results instead of standing up MCP servers, which matters because the
things worth testing here are *ordering* and *what happens when a call is refused*, and neither
of those is about a real server.

Note the asymmetry with ``hera_tools.ports``: those exist because that package **may not**
import what it needs. This one may — the layering table allows it — and does, for the concrete
type in the application. That is the difference between a port that inverts a dependency and
one that narrows it.
