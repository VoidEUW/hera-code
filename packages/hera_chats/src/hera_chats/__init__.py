"""hera_chats — projects, chats, the persisted event stream, and the turn orchestrator.

The layer that owns a conversation. It takes a provider, a prompt builder, a skill router and a
tool registry — all injected, none of them named concretely — and turns one message into one
stream of events that is both what the browser renders and what the database keeps.

**Nothing here raises.** A turn closes with a reason rather than throwing, because its consumer
is a Server-Sent Events response and an exception mid-stream is a connection that simply stops.
There is no error module: a 404 for a chat that is not yours belongs to whoever serves HTTP.

A **project** is a container with behaviour: instructions, pinned skills, a default profile.
A **turn** is the loop in ARCHITECTURE.md. A **message** stores the events it was made of,
which is what makes the server render authoritative at ``done``.
